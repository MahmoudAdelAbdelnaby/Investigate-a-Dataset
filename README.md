# Investigate-a-Dataset
Hello and Welcome to my brief analysis of a clinic no show rate. Why is this dataset and the analysis of it important? Simply in any business you're running you need to assess the forecasted visit rates to be able to plan staffing accordingly, Which would help cutting down costs of having un utilized staff and when to promote and market your business.
